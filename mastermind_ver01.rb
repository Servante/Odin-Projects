Assignment


1. - Build the game assuming the computer randomly selects the secret colors and the human player must guess them. Remember that you need to give the proper feedback on how good the guess was each turn!- complete

2 - Now refactor your code to allow the human player to choose whether he/she wants to be the creator of the secret code or the guesser.

3. - Build it out so that the computer will guess if you decide to choose your own secret colors. Start by having the computer guess randomly (but keeping the ones that match exactly).

4. - Next, add a little bit more intelligence to the computer player so that, if the computer has guessed the right color but the wrong position, its next guess will need to include that color somewhere. Feel free to make the AI even smarter.

------

*full game

-is either player vs player or player vs computer

-decide on who many rounds in a game. has to be an even number. 

-codemaker earns points. one point for every guess, and one extra point if the other person can't solve it. winner is based on who has the most points. 

pieces:

decoding board (one board with four holes, smaller board to the side with four small holes)
code pegs - six different colors (red[r], green[g], blue[b], yellow[y], pink[p], orange[o])
key pegs -  black and white (for this game we will use x's and o's)
	-X = for correct color and position
	-O = for correct color, but not the position


To Do:

-rewrite instructions - X
-rework instructions in code telling user to type 'help' to view them.
-if easy, rewrite code so that when the user responds yes to play again, it goes straight to choose role
-update the game_win methods to reflect user name or Hal
-clean up alien references (save this to expand on the game in the future, where you track points/rounds)
-update to introduce Hal. note which difficulty he chooses. 
-create an array of famous computer names, and randomly name the bot
-play through and add newlines
-remove all evidence of pry

	Mastermind is a codebreaking game. A pattern of four colors is created, and the 
	player has muliple attempts to guess this pattern. Feedback is given on each 
	guess that contains clues to how close the player came to guessing the correct 
	pattern. 

	You choose to be either the codemaker or codebreaker. If you prefer to create
	an unbreakable code, a computer oppenent will be chosen to try and crack it. If
	you decide you want to test your own logical prowess, a computer oppenent will 
	create a pattern more secure than Fort Knox for you to bang your head against. 


THE CODE PEGS

	There will be six colors to choose from when you guess, but this is a terminal 
	game after all, so the colors will be represented by the first letter of the 
	word of the color. 

	red[r], green[g], blue[b], yellow[y], pink[p], orange[o]

THE KEY PEGS

	The key pegs will give you clues to how close your guess was. X's tell you 
	that you got one code peg the correct color and position; while O reveals 
	that only the color was correct. Review your feed back along with your 
	guesses to make more informed a3ttempts. 

THE DECODING BOARD

	As you play the board will create itself. See below for a sample line from the
	board:


	Attempt 1: [r, y, p, r] Feedback: [-, O, O, X]

	
	The above tells you the attempt number you're on and your guess pattern. From 
	the feedback we can see that we got one completely wrong (-), two colored pegs 
	correct, but not in the right position (O,O), and one was dead on in both color 
	and position (X).
