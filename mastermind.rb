	Mastermind is a codebreaking game. A pattern of six colors is created, and the 
	player has muliple attempts to guess the pattern. Feedback is given on each 
	guess that contains clues to how close the player came to guessing the correct 
	pattern. 


THE CODE PEGS

	There will be six colors to choose from when you guess, but this is a terminal 
	game after all, so the colors will be represented by the first letter of the 
	word of the color. 

	red[r], green[g], blue[b], yellow[y], pink[p], orange[o]

THE KEY PEGS

	The key pegs will give you clues to how close your guess was. X's tell you 
	that you got one code peg the correct color and position; while O reveals 
	that only the color was correct. Review your feed back along with your 
	guesses to make more informed attempts. 

THE DECODING BOARD

	As you play the board will create itself. See below for a sample line from the
	board:


	Attempt 1: [r, y, p, r] Feedback: [-, O, O, X]

	
	The above tells you the attempt number you're on and your guess pattern. From 
	the feedback we can see that we got one completely wrong (-), two colored pegs 
	correct, but not in the right position (O,O), and one was dead on in both color 
	and position (X).
